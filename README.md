# CPU-Scheduler-Simulator
CPU Schedular Simulator: is a Project for Simulating the different Techniques CPU Handling Processes in the Ready Queue. Techniques Simulated (Shortest Job First, Shortest Remaining Time First, Priority Scheduling and AG)

Summary Describe each Technique.

1- SJR(Shortest Job First)

    CPU Takes take the Process with the Shortest Time(Burst) and Excute it. It could be pre-emptive where running process should be the one with shortest running time

2- SRTF(Shortest Remaining Time First)
  Assoicate with each Process
