# CPU-Scheduler-Simulator
CPU Schedular Simulator: is a Project for Simulating the different Techniques CPU Handling Processes in the Ready Queue. Techniques Simulated (Shortest Job First, Shortest Remaining Time First, Priority Scheduling and AG)

Summary Describe each Technique.

1- SJR(Shortest Job First)

  Associate with each process the length of its next CPU burst, Use these
lengths to schedule the process with the shortest time.

2- SRTF(Shortest Remaining Time First)
